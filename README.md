# Anime List Flutter App
## Vision Statement
This mobile app uses streams to add, move, and sort two different lists of shows retreived from my Cloud Firestore database.

Next tasks are to:
 - continue updating the UI
 - create a second horizontal list for watched anime
 - custom images per card

More about this app will be documented soon!
